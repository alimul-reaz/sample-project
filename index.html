                            monastery is home to bronze statues and centuries-old Buddhist manuscripts. South of town,
                            the
                            tropical
                            rainforest of Himchari National Park has waterfalls and many birds. North, sea turtles breed
                            on
                            nearby
                            Sonadia Island.</h3>
